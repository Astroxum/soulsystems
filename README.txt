Known bugs: Teleport not completly finished and only teleports to one bonfire even without interaction
	    Bonfire menu not interactable with controllers

Finished and fixed systems: Bonfire restore stamina and health and set spawn point
			    Health and stamina
			    Death screen
			    Sprint using stamina
			    Interact and interact widgets

Bug Fixes: Added a check for regen function that will stop it if the player is running, without it the stamina will regen 	   	   consistently after the first release of shift key
           Created a check for the pressed button for running to not consume stamina if you stayed in place and keep it pressed 	   anymore
	   Fixed a bug that made the stamina go over 100 when interacting with the bonfire and respawning
           Smoothen the stamina and health progress bar
